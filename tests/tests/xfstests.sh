# Run a specific set of tests in xfstests and make sure they pass.  This
# references an external existing xfstests repo.  It points xfstests at
# the first scoutfs mount and its device.
#
# This is a bit odd as a test because it's really running a bunch of
# tests on its own.  We want to see their output as they progress.
# so we restore output to stdout while xfstests is running.  We manually
# generate compared output from the check.log that xfstests procuces
# which lists the tests that were run and their result.
#
# _flakey_drop_and_remount drops writes during unmount, this stops a
# server from indicating that it is done and it will be fenced by the
# next server.. it's right there in the comment: "to simulate a crash".
# our fencing agent would find that the mount isn't actually live
# anymore and would be fine.  For now it just barks out a warning
# in dmesg.
