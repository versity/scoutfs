/*
 * This quorum subsystem is responsible for ensuring that only one
 * server is ever running among the mounts and has exclusive read/write
 * access to the server structures in the metadata device.
 *
 * A specific set of mounts are quorum members as indicated by the
 * quorum_slot_nr mount option.  That option refers to the slot in the
 * super block that contains their configuration.  Only these mounts
 * participate in the election of the leader.
 *
 * As each quorum member mounts it starts background work that uses a
 * simplified raft leader election protocol to elect a leader.  Each
 * mount listens on a udp socket at the address found in its slot in the
 * super block.  It then sends and receives raft messages to and from
 * the other slot addresses in the super block.  As the protocol
 * progresses eventually a mount will receive enough votes to become the
 * leader.  We're not using the full key-value store of raft, just the
 * leadership election.  Much of the functionality matches the raft
 * concepts (roles, messages, timeouts) but there's no key value logs to
 * synchronize.
 *
 * Once elected leader, the mount now has to ensure that it's the only
 * running server.  There could be previously elected servers still
 * running (maybe they've deadlocked, or lost network communications).
 * In addition to a configuration slot in the super block, each quorum
 * member also has a known block location that represents their slot.
 * The block contains an array of events which are updated during the life
 * time of the quorum agent.  The elected leader set its elected event
 * and can then start the server.
 *
 * It's critical to raft elections that a participant's term not go
 * backwards in time so each mount also uses its quorum block to store
 * the greatest term it has used in messages.
 *
 * The quorum work still runs in the background while the server is
 * running.  The leader quorum work will regularly send heartbeat
 * messages to the other quorum members to keep them from electing a new
 * leader.  If the server shuts down, or the mount disappears, the other
 * quorum members will stop receiving heartbeats and will elect a new
 * leader.
 *
 * Typically we require a strict majority of the configured quorum
 * members to elect a leader.  However, for simple usability, we do
 * allow a majority of 1 when there are only one or two quorum members.
 * In the two member case this can lead to split elections where each
 * mount races to elect itself as leader and attempt to fence the other.
 * The random election timeouts in raft make this unlikely, but it is
 * possible.
