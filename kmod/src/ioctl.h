/*
 * (These fields are documented in the order that they're displayed by
 * the scoutfs cli utility which matches the sort order of the rules.)
 *
 * @prio: The priority of the rule.  Rules are sorted by their fields
 * with prio at the highest magnitude.  When multiple rules match the
 * rule with the highest sort order is enforced.  The priority field
 * lets rules override the default field sort order.
 *
 * @name_val[3]: The three 64bit values that make up the name of the
 * totl xattr whose total will be checked against the rule's limit to
 * see if the quota rule has been exceeded.  The behavior of the values
 * can be changed by their corresponding name_source and name_flags.
 *
 * @name_source[3]: The SQ_NS_ enums that control where the value comes
 * from.  _LITERAL uses the value from name_val.  Inode attribute
 * sources (_PROJ, _UID, _GID) are taken from the inode of the operation
 * that is being checked against the rule.
 *
 * @name_flags[3]: The SQ_NF_ enums that alter the name values.  _SELECT
 * makes the rule only match if the inode attribute of the operation
 * matches the attribute value stored in name_val.  This lets rules
 * match a specific value of an attribute rather than mapping all
 * attribute values of to totl names.
 *
 * @op: The SQ_OP_ enums which specify the operation that can't exceed
 * the rule's limit.  _INODE checks inode creation and the inode
 * attributes are taken from the inode that would be created.  _DATA
 * checks file data block allocation and the inode fields come from the
 * inode that is allocating the blocks.
 *
 * @limit: The 64bit value that is checked against the totl value
 * described by the rule.  If the totl value is greater than or equal to
 * this value of the matching rule then the operation will return
 * -EDQUOT.
 *
 * @rule_flags: SQ_RF_TOTL_COUNT indicates that the rule's limit should
 * be checked against the number of xattrs contributing to a totl value
 * instead of the sum of the xattrs.
